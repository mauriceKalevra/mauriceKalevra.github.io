Right now im thinking about topics to write my bachelor thesis about.  
Initially i wanted to define and implement a siem system within a dockerized environment. But my proffessor almost laughed that idea of. Apparently containers are overused and almost all systems have been built with them. Hence the idea is not suited for a thesis. What a shame. Would've been super easy, yet interesting. He recommended to write about container security. Im looking for papers around that. Any other ideas, surrounding virtualisation and containers?
