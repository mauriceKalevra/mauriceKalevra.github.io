War sucks!  
Especially if you have biased media that makes it hart to determine whos the baddie in this conflicts!  
  
A conflict feels much worse if you dont choose sites!  

If you know you're fighting evil, conflict is much easier to cobe with!

If you can't tell, who's the evil party, it adds another nervracking complexity on top!

As a kid i always though it's almost pre deetermined who's evil and who isn't. In reality that's often very hard to tell!
